For the time being we do not offer a separate Wikipedia for the free version. Instead, you are welcome to check **[ChatControl's Pro Wikipedia](https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki)** that contains very similar information, except that some features are missing or labeled differently in the free version. Please keep in mind that ChatControl Free is no longer receiving updates except for critical vulnerability patches. To support our development, please consider purchasing the Pro version!

If you have any **questions or bugs to report**, try seeing if [those can be resolved quickly](https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) by yourself. If that does not help, you are welcome to **fill an issue**. Please read the [Getting Help the Best Way](https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Getting-Help-the-Right-Way) to obtain help as quickly as possible.

Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy:

<i>Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.</i>
